# Portfolio
My motivation for this project was to practice using HTML and CSS to design a Porfolio page. I was able to practice with new techniques that I have learned throught class and my online exploring. 

I enjoyed building this project to see what I have learned and how it is translated from code to page. This was an opportinty to grow as a programer/coder while recieving feedback. 

This page gives me a start for people to get to know me and see my skills. As I continue to learn the page with become increasingly stronger and have all the infomation my peers and future
employers with be looking for. I will be able to update and make changes. 

I learned a lot about CSS edits and moving pictured/text around the page. The ability to create 'containers' and edit the code within. 

I am proud of this project and I hope it can stand out with the integration of buttons to make it easier to access my information (TBD)
